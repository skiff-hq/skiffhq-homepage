          <p>Welcome aboard. SkiffHQ is a dedicated space for those who live and breathe microskiffs — from first builds to refined setups. Whether you’re poling skinny flats at sunrise, tuning a lightweight hull, or just getting your feet wet, you’ll find your crew here.</p>
          <p>We’re boaters, builders, anglers, and explorers. This isn’t just a forum — it’s a growing hub of knowledge, rigging insight, gear reviews, DIY ideas, and firsthand advice. Ask questions, share your build, trade tips, and help shape the next wave of skinny water craft.</p>

          <h2 class="major">Inside the SkiffHQ Community</h2>
          <span class="image main"><img src="images/community.jpg" alt="Skiff community collaboration" /></span>
          <p>SkiffHQ isn’t just a forum — it’s a gathering place. From seasoned guides to backyard builders, this is where people come to swap ideas, post their rigs, and troubleshoot the unique challenges of shallow-water boating.</p>
          <p>What sets us apart is what we <em>leave out</em>: no ads, no tracking, no clutter. Just clean conversation, helpful advice, and a space built by and for the community — not by algorithms or ad networks.</p>
          <p>You’ll discover build logs, technical Q&A, launch-day photos, and input from real boaters. Whether you're deep into your fifth skiff or dreaming up your first, SkiffHQ is where the conversation starts.</p>
          <p>We value respect, curiosity, generosity, and builder-to-builder support. This is a place to share what you’ve learned and learn something new — no ego, no noise.</p>
          <p><strong>This space exists because of you. Join the crew and help it grow.</strong></p>

          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>SkiffHQ is here to bring microskiff folks together — the builders, the boaters, the obsessed and the curious. Our goal is simple: create a clean, ad-free place to share ideas, ask questions, and celebrate life in shallow water.</p>

          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <p>We’re building a space that’s useful, honest, and focused. A place where skiff owners can learn, share, and stay connected — without distractions, noise, or ads.</p>

          <h3>What We Believe</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>We believe knowledge should be shared, not hoarded.</li>
            <li>We believe good boats and good answers both come from experience.</li>
            <li>We believe in clean water, clean builds, and clean conversations.</li>
            <li>We believe in helping the next person, even if you're still figuring it out yourself.</li>
            <li>We believe the best community is the one you help shape.</li>
          </ul>
